## Description.
This web page introduces what client does and navigate from top menu to required article.
### Changes in HTML file
On this file i have changed all `<div>` elements to the semantic elements for more readability such as `<article>, <aside>, <footer>, <main>, <header>`. I created one `<img>` tag, and added recourses were on css file which is not practical, and added `<alt>` property to `<img>`.
### Changes in stile.css file
I moved background image to `index.html` file
```
background-image: url("../images/digital-marketing-meeting.jpg");
```
which was not usual for me.
### Main take out from here.
- Semantic html tags.
- I can put picture in css as background image.
- Learning to write README.md markdown file.
